TO DO:

Fix all the god damn rendering code
Make some of the colors less ghastly
Elevation, biomes etc
Player token
Map regen—if less than 500 land, more than ⅔ of screen, etc
Make ocean a thing
Make borders have neighbors
Fix biome generation and colouring (I’m a brit)


colliders are death

Makes some enemies to fight
Actually gen a world
Do all the sad terrain stuff --> simons job
